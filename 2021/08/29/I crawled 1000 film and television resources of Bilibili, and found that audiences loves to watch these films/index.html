<p>The article was first published on Zhihu: <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/401896196">https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/401896196</a></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h1 id="Motivation-and-data-sources"><a href="#Motivation-and-data-sources" class="headerlink" title="Motivation and data sources"></a>Motivation and data sources</h1><p>The motivation at the beginning was actually very simple. I remembered that when I was bored outside, I hoped to watch some videos to relieve my boredom, but I encountered the dilemma of no data many times. I wondered if I could crawl all the film and television resources of Bilibili to see which ones can be downloaded. Woolen cloth? (In the first two years, all film and television works can be downloaded, but with the strengthening of copyright awareness in China, more and more videos show: “Because of copyright restrictions, only online viewing”, even platinum member is just helpless.)</p>
<p>After having this idea, I feel that I have climbed all over again. Why don’t I find some data, including but not limited to the link of the video, qualifications (whether a large member is required), number of plays, country, video introduction, actors, video type , ratings, and our starting point: downloadable or not.</p>
<p>For the source of crawled data, if the title is: “I found out what movies my uncle likes to buy”, then crawling all the movies is the solution to the problem, but this is obviously unnecessary. So this article turns the focus to the top 380 movies, TV dramas and TV dramas with the highest number of broadcasts respectively. You could say that the most viewed movie may not be a good one, but it must be attractive enough. What are the conditions of the videos that attract viewers, what type of videos do users of Bilibili prefer, as a video sharing platform started with two-dimensional animation, whether Bilibili still maintains his “original intention”, these are all in this article. Want to find out the problem.</p>
<h1 id="Movie"><a href="#Movie" class="headerlink" title="Movie"></a>Movie</h1><p>In the past few months, whether it is ghosts, miscellaneous talk, or even in the global Chinese debate competition a week ago, the debaters have demonstrated through the example of Huang Shilang “whether the appearance of the original god is the highlight moment of domestic games”, making “Let the Bullets Fly” This film, which has been released for more than ten years, has returned to the public’s field of vision again, and even has a tendency to break the circle (by the way, the debate competition is also very interesting, you can watch it if you are interested). Wonderful lines, compact plot and well-liked famous scenes have established him as the number one broadcaster.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/9xMhbF1UtTXaiBl.png" alt="dataframe roughly.png"><br>It is not surprising to find that the variety of movies is blooming. It can be seen that the tastes of the audience are very mixed. Whether it is from the most popular “plot” to the very small “gods and demons”, “sports” are all in the broadcast ranking (top 380). occupy a place. Among them, plot, action, fantasy, and comedy have the largest audience, but in general, the distribution is quite balanced.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/IwkvjSW4NA1Jtc5.png" alt="Type of movie.png"><br>In the analysis of movies and distribution countries, I found that “Japan” or “China” are not the distribution countries for the most watched movies, and the first place is won by “United States”, which is actually a bit surprising to me, because regardless of the number of views No. 1 “Let the Bullets Fly”, or No. 2 “Your Name.” , not even a single American movie appeared in this entire top 10 list. This is because the top ten movies except “Let the Bullets Fly” have only been released in recent years. From the popularity at the time of release, the “two-dimensional” characteristics of Bilibili and the reputation of the movie have attracted more Classic high-reputation American movies have more audiences, and the phenomenon that American movies have a high overall viewing volume but fail to hit the top ten on the list will appear.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/kV4Ae8PgNQRHqod.png" alt="Film and Country.png"><br>When it comes to American movies, the first category that comes to my mind is sci-fi. From Marvel superheroes to the hardcore and brain-burning Interstellar, the Hollywood-style special effects are really shocking. The impression of Japanese movies may be the extreme pictures of Makoto Shinkai; the mainland movies bring me the feeling of a New Year’s Eve and comedy films every year; Hong Kong, China brings action martial arts, or Stephen Chow-style funny and nonsensical; British The magical world of Harry Potter; the romantic and lazy love story of France… These are my “stereotypes” of movies in various countries. Comparing the relationship between countries and types in the picture below, I found that some stereotypes are almost the same Yes, perhaps we can say: film is a way of exporting the impression of the country?<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/1Do3tPGXCEuMdQw.png" alt="Country&amp;Type.png"><br>I dug into the relationship between movie ratings and the number of movies. Sure enough, most viewers chose high-rated movies, but the scattered “3.2 points” and “2.7 points” aroused my interest: the most viewed “bad” What will the film be?<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/h9NmWk364SGYqdg.png" alt="movie rating.png"><br>After removing a few films that could not be evaluated, such as “I Repair Cultural Relics in the Forbidden City” and “The Founding of the Party”, I found these low-scoring Chinese and foreign films below 6.0. “Detective Chinatown 3” is really bad. “Tang Detective 2” has such a good reputation that it made the audience wait for two years. In the end, it turned into a variety show and adventure into an advertisement, which really disappointed me.</p>
<p>On the contrary, watching “Shanghai Fortress” when I knew it was a bad movie made me happy for a long time, with the humorous barrage and Lu Han’s indescribable acting skills, as well as the classic tribute line - “Shoot me. !” Maybe watching this movie with a pastime mentality and no expectations brought unimagined happiness instead. After watching the movie and then reading the book of the same name, I don’t think there is any relationship between the two at all. I just want to complain that the old thief in Jiangnan is ruining his ip again.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/yLBzpXNv1bcMhDW.png" alt="Bad film.png"><br>At the same time, I listed the actors who participated in these low-score films through cloud maps. What surprised me was that Andy Lau’s name was unusually eye-catching. At the same time, we could also see some familiar faces, such as Lu Han, Dapeng, Bao Beier . And the names of foreign stars don’t seem to have any reference value, so I won’t list them.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/uRJyeEGOrkBSsth.png" alt="Chinese bad actors.png"><br>With the low-scoring actors, I am naturally curious as to who the high-scoring actors will go to, because the score of Bilibili is inflated, so I strictly define the standard for high-scoring movies: no less than 9.8 points . In addition to old actors like Ge You, Feng Xiaogang, Jiang Wen, and Chow Yun-fat, I also saw unfamiliar names like “Shan Xin and Ao Lei”. After a search on Baidu, I found out that they are dubbing actors who have dubbed “Luo Xiaohei Wars”. “, “Kuiba” high-scoring and high-volume anime movies, this is also an exclusive feature of Bilibili.</p>
<p>The names of foreign actors are some household names in English. Names like “Tom, John, Richard” obviously cannot refer to a specific actor, which may reflect that these English names are really bad.</p>
<p>(Because of the relationship between wordcloud and the actor list, there is a probability that anime characters will appear in the picture, especially in fan dramas, so we will also see some anime characters, such as “Manji”, “Man Xiaoman” (Kuiba))<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/ZsqH1AL9SRQMweJ.png" alt="Chinese high score actor.png"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/OhNX8cHZgBzqPv3.png" alt="Foreign High Score Actor.png"><br>So back to our initial question, which of these 380 films can be downloaded and which major members can watch?<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/YvuPXTkifxZVJQB.png" alt="Membership and download and df.png"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/HrcT8lukvWA4dEP.png" alt="Membership and Download.png"><br>In general, movies that require members to watch account for about 70% of the entire ranking, and the number that can be downloaded also accounts for 70%. For users who love watching movies, my suggestion is: there is no need for membership, because the real Movies out of the circle, like “Let the Bullets Fly” and “Your Name.” “He doesn’t need membership, and if he doesn’t have the foundation to watch Fan Fan, in other words, he is not a senior user of Bilibili, 80% of them won’t watch the movie version of Fan Drama of the same name (the table of all 380 films is at the bottom of the article) .</p>
<h1 id="Fan-drama"><a href="#Fan-drama" class="headerlink" title="Fan drama"></a>Fan drama</h1><p>As a video site that started with the second element, a large number of exclusives and serial dramas have ensured sufficient user stickiness and loyalty at Bilibili, such as the new Japanese national-level animation “Ghost Slayer” and the recent fire “Curse” Combat” has a good performance.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/wp6AgV4Dex2jEUY.png" alt="Fan drama ranking top ten.png"><br>At first, I thought that Bilibili defined Fanju as a Japanese anime, but when I checked the country and region, I found four animes that were not from Japan, but were also included in the “Fanju” list:<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/YBTsZ8xz3CtrmF9.png" alt="Non-Japanese Fan Drama.png"><br>In terms of genre, the result this time is more in line with my impression of Japan than the movie: whether it is a hot-blooded adaptation of high-quality comics like Spell Fighting, Ghost Slayer, or a different world with a bad theme in recent years Time travel is still like “My Youth Love Story. There is really a problem. “, “Bingguo” and other campus fan, all occupy a considerable place in the fan drama category.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/XrmzDakQVRIM8JT.png" alt="The type of drama.png"><br>The number of broadcasts and ratings of fan dramas are basically proportional, and I am interested in a few animes with a lower number of parts.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/x6UZEW5m1SN9Twr.png" alt="Fan drama rating.png"><br>Perhaps the definition of a low-score fan below 6.0 is too kind, or it may be because the audience atstation B  has a strong tolerance for fan dramas. In the list, I have heard of “Boren Biography”, this “flammable”. “Unit”, the only thing I’ve really seen is “The Promised Neverland Season 2”. Maybe it’s because I haven’t read the comics, and I don’t have a relationship with high expectations. I subjectively think that “The Promised Neverland Season 2” is actually not bad. He completely told the whole story and gave a good ending. I already very satisfied. But it is undeniable that there is really a big gap between him and the first season. From the wits in the first season to the fast-paced plots, inexplicable literary dramas and underfunded battles in the second season, fans are angry to 2.7 The points are also excusable. It reflects the saying - the greater the expectation, the greater the disappointment.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/Mqrxt8yD37NhJaH.png" alt="Bad film.png"><br>The following are the low-scoring and high-scoring seiyuu, because I didn’t pay too much attention to this, so I won’t do too much analysis, and because the code is not smart enough (lazy), you can see “Uzumaki Naruto” and “Nohara Shinnosuke” Such a familiar name.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/yGFJeD2hv57SQTV.png" alt="Low-grade voice actress.png"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/aNbBp8VzgKUmMF2.png" alt="High Score Fan Voice Actor.png"><br>The above cloud map did not bring me useful data, I can only picture it for fun. Next time, you can try to include the director and screenwriter. The appearance of seiyuu does not represent the level of this drama, but the director and screenwriter must bear greater responsibilities.</p>
<p>Fan dramas that can be downloaded only account for nearly 30% of the entire list (380 fan dramas), and the rest of the content is not downloadable. From the top ten downloadable fan dramas list, we can roughly infer that these fan dramas are animations from five years ago or even longer. Although the picture quality may not be as beautiful as in recent years, the high score must be enough for people to overcome reason for the image quality.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/edBSYMgILXnAy58.png" alt="Membership and Download.png"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/AFcdsj8y37ZuUqB.png" alt="Top ten downloadable.png"></p>
<h1 id="TV-drama"><a href="#TV-drama" class="headerlink" title="TV drama"></a>TV drama</h1><p>At the beginning, Bilibili occupied a place in the TV series through good exclusive Japanese drama resources, such as “Escape is Shameful But Useful”, “The Lonely Gourmet” and four famous novels. Here I have to mention the special area of ​​Bilibili, the ghost animal area, whether it is from Zhuge Liang a long time ago (“I have never seen such a brazen person”) to the “Da Tang Gang”, which is known as the treasure of the town station, Countless up masters in the ghost animal area have redistributed TV dramas decades ago for the second spring through tuning, filling in lyrics, and editing, arousing the enthusiasm of young people to revisit the classics.</p>
<p>And now we can’t even see a single Japanese drama in the top ten of the entire broadcast rankings. It is reasonable to speculate that Bilibili is now focusing on creating exclusive TV dramas, and the audience is more aimed at young people in their 20s. “The Sky of the Wind Dog”, “Sudden Vacation” and “Double Mirror” are all examples of the transformation to exclusive production and production.</p>
<p>(Why is the number of broadcasts so high? One is that the users of Bilibili match the audience of TV dramas, and the other is that the publicity is very strong.)<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/qZStmHV1OIKyLTJ.png" alt="TV series rankings are true.png"><br>The genre of the TV series is similar to the movie, the only difference is that there are several elements unique to China —— “Military”, “Martial Arts”, “Spy War”.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/7U8RLe5M2SCVKcm.png" alt="Types of TV series.png"><br>Mainland China and Japan occupy 80% of the TV drama market at Bilibili, which also coincides with our above inference.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/3aFCvjUuV8tki1y.png" alt="TV series and countries.png"><br>Among them, the types of Japanese TV dramas are not as diverse as those in mainland China. The most popular ones are mainly plot, urban, funny, and emotional. This also matches my impression of Japanese dramas. On the mainland, due to the relatively cheap copyrights of some old TV dramas, the types are more complex, and the audience may be more diverse (“The Hunting Ground”, “Iron Teeth Bronze Teeth Ji Xiaolan”, “Balala Little Devil”, etc. has more than 5 million plays).<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/7pz3TaK15HDtWyA.png" alt="Country&amp;Type.png"><br>Compared with movies and TV dramas, only a few of the top 380 TV dramas have a score lower than 6.0. With the mentality of looking for fun, I listed their information. It turns out that I haven’t seen one of them, and there is no room for divergence… If anyone has seen it, they can comment on why they have such a low rating. Although the score is unqualified, there is no very low score like “The Promised Neverland Season 2” and “Shanghai Fortress”.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/5P4NfkxhBjHA93T.png" alt="TV Rating.png"><br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/ieZQvGSqdoT2Wy3.png" alt="Bad drama.png"><br>The actors who have watched low-scoring TV series have no familiar names, and the data itself is only 6, so there is no cloud map for low-scoring actors. Let’s take a look at some of the familiar faces of the cast of high-scoring TV shows.</p>
<p>Because audiences generally have stricter requirements for domestic TV dramas, I define the standard for high-scoring movies as above 9.5 points, otherwise what we will see will all be TV dramas with “memories killing” and “important film and television status”. A few years of TV series may rarely have a score higher than 9.8.</p>
<p>The first is Chinese actors (please ignore this big “decoration”): Zhuge Liang in “Romance of the Three Kingdoms”, Shen Aojun in “The Magician Xile Le”, and Liu Xiaolingtong in “Journey to the West” are all classics and can’t be more classics Role. Among so many names, I was pleasantly surprised to see Kan Qingzi and Liu Meihan. Their “Sudden Holiday” gave me a fresh and relaxed feeling like a Japanese drama. There are not so many bloody plots, but the focus is on It has left a good impression on me in terms of the character’s heart and family relationships.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/dWDjxs4QCaVqcB7.png" alt="Chinese high score actor.png"><br>I don’t watch a lot of Japanese dramas, but I’m still very happy to see a few familiar faces: Yui Aragaki, Gen Hoshino, Takayuki Yamada, Masaki Sugata, etc. But I always feel as if there is one person missing - Satomi Ishihara!</p>
<p>The first Japanese drama I watched was “Unnatural Death” starring her. Whether it was an easy unit, rigorous mainline, and touching acting skills, it made me think for the first time that TV dramas can still be played like this. In the later “Reading Girl Kono Etsuko”, although it has a little morning drama look and feel, but after reading it, it is like my soul has been healed, and it will remind me to be an independent and kind person. Here I will mention that the role of green tea in “Love Bros. Chocolate Professional” is very fresh and attractive, but the whole story simply shocked my three views. I can’t remember what I said in general. season finale.<br><img src="https://i.loli.net/2021/08/29/FyoKASM9RwqgUHX.png" alt="Foreign High Score Actor.png"><br>Where did Satomi Ishihara go? I searched for “Ishihara Satomi” directly at Bilibili, and I can still display slices of TV dramas and even variety shows that she starred in. Could it be that I missed the climb? On August 25, 2021, I visited the TV drama index interface again and found that there were really no TV dramas for her. The most played Japanese drama was “Lonely Gourmet” (41.376 million plays), and “Unnatural Death” (8939.9 10,000 plays) but disappeared. At present, the reason is not known. When I asked the customer service, he also said that the search results shall prevail. He sounded like he knew about this matter, but he would not fix the problem.</p>
<p>Basically all Japanese dramas are not allowed to be downloaded, and the TV series produced by Bilibili are also not allowed to download except “The Sky of the Wind Dog” (you can try to watch this drama, except for the final ending screenwriter Cerebral Thrombosis Others are fine). The rest of the TV series are those TV series that have been in the era and basically have on every film and television platform. If you don’t want to eat it with the barrage, then there is absolutely no need to watch it at Bilibili.</p>
